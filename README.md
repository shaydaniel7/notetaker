# Note Taker Application

## Description

This app will allow a user to create and save notes, view previously saved notes, and delete previously saved notes. For people who need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
